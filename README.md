# Ski Slope Robot (Command-Based)

This is a command-based version of team 3166's "ski slope" robot used at the 2022 AMES competition, created for practicing the command-based robot coding paradigm.

Some parts of this implementation are over-engineered for practice purposes (e.g., moving the gate arm to the open and closed positions).
